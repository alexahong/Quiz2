\section{File List}
Here is a list of all documented files with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{college_8h}{college.\+h} \\*This is the header file for \hyperlink{college_8h}{college.\+h} that will load all classes and hours into a file and can also remove classes. it will determine what your G\+PA is from your grades and credit hours }{\pageref{college_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{collegemain_8cc}{collegemain.\+cc} \\*This is the main for Project 3, which asks you to build a container that holds a list of college courses. The courses are always kept in order, so they never need to be sorted since they are always inserted in the order where they go. You will also need the files\+: \hyperlink{course_8h}{course.\+h} course.\+cc \hyperlink{node_8h}{node.\+h} in order to do this project. You will be writing both the .h and the .cc file for the container }{\pageref{collegemain_8cc}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{course_8h}{course.\+h} \\*This class stores the three essential features of a completed college course\+: the course number, the grade received, and the credit hours for the course. The get\+\_\+number\+\_\+grade will return the numeric equivalent of a letter grade as used in the standard 4 point system }{\pageref{course_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{node_8h}{node.\+h} \\*This file is borrowed heavily from Main/\+Savitch \char`\"{}\+Data Structures and
     Other Object Using C++,\char`\"{} Chapter 5. It features a node class that can be used in the construction of linked lists }{\pageref{node_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{tarray_8h}{tarray.\+h} \\*This is a class to introduce you to the syntax of working with template classes. Notice that the type being stored is completely anonymous. Your assignment is to implent the eight functions listed in this header in a tarray.\+template file }{\pageref{tarray_8h}}{}
